# OWC Channel Model(Relative)
Category: Channel Models

Block Name: OWC Channel Model(Relative)

## Overview
The `OWC_Channel_Model(Relative)` block in the `gr-owc` module simulates the optical channel's behavior in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. This block models the relationship between the electrical signals from ùëÅ transmitters and the corresponding electrical signals received at ùëÄ receivers. It accounts for emission and acceptance angles, as well as distances between each of the ùëÅ ùëÄ transmitter-receiver pairs. The Lambertian orders, which describe the directional emission characteristics of the ùëÅ transmitters, are parameterized. On the receiver side, parameters such as the photosensor area, optical filter gain, refractive index, and concentrator field-of-view (FOV) are defined for each of the ùëÄ receivers. Additionally, conversion factors for both electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical processes are specified for all ùëÅ transmitters and ùëÄ receivers.

## Parameters

## Description

### DC Channel Gain Formula
The DC channel gain from transmitter \( i \) to receiver \( j \) is given by:

$$
H_{ij} = \frac{G_T(\phi_{ij}) \cdot G_R(\psi_{ij})}{d_{ij}^2}
$$

where:
- $\( \phi_{ij} \)$ is the emission angle from transmitter i to receiver j.
- $\( \psi_{ij} \)$ is the acceptance angle of receiver j.
- $\( d_{ij} \)$ is the distance between transmitter i and receiver j.
- $\( G_T(\phi_{ij}) \)$ and $\( G_R(\psi_{ij}) \)$ are the transmit and receive gains as functions of the emission and reception angles, respectively.

### Transmit and Receive Gain Functions
For the commonly used point source model with Lambertian emission, the gain functions are defined as follows:

- **Transmit Gain $\( G_T(\phi_{ij}) \)$**:

$$
G_T(\phi) = \frac{m + 1}{2 \pi} \cdot \cos^m(\phi)
$$

where \( m \) is the Lambertian order.

- **Receive Gain $\( G_R(\psi_{ij}) \)$**:

$$
G_R(\psi) = A_T \cdot T_s \cdot g(\psi) \cdot \cos(\psi)
$$

where:
- $\( A_T \)$ is the photosensor area.
- $\( T_s \)$ is the optical filter transmittance.
- $\( g(\psi) \)$ is the gain function for a concentrator lens, given by:

$$
g(\psi) = \frac{n^2}{\sin^2(\Psi_C)} \text{ for } 0 \leq \psi \leq \Psi_C
$$

and 0 otherwise, where \( n \) is the refractive index and $\( \Psi_C \)$ is the field-of-view (FOV) of the lens.

### Signal Power and Conversion Factors
In a system with multiple transmitters and receivers, the total optical signal power incident on a given receiver‚Äôs photosensor is the sum of the received power from all transmitters. To account for the conversion between electrical and optical domains, we assume that the conversion factors $\( C_T \)$ (electrical to optical) and $\( C_R \)$ (optical to electrical) are constants. The received electrical signal is related to the transmitted signal by the constant factor $\( C_T \cdot C_R \cdot H_{ij} \)$.

The received signal at receiver \( j \) is:

$$
y(t) = \sum_i C_T^{(i)} \cdot C_R^{(j)} \cdot H_{ij} \cdot x(t)
$$

where $\( x(t) \)$ is the transmitted signal.

## Summary
